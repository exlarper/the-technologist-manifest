# The Technologist Manifest

Inspired by Marc Andreessen's disgusting grift "The Techno-optimist Manifesto," this is an open-source document that defines what it means to be a technologist, and who we are kicking out. There's a beautiful irony to taking what is theirs and making it ours.

## Philosophy

Lots of this was inspired by geohot's blog but this manifest is rooted in identifying and shaming those who can't answer this question: **If the money and users went away, would you still be building?**

Technologists build the magical box because the box needs to exist, not because some retards want to put ads in it or a soulless VC will invest in it. Talent is everything, status is nothing. Strivers can fuck right off to x dot com. YC says build something people want, I say build technology you want.

### Core Principles

**Fuck the Larpers** If you came to be a performative larper you're an entryist who never cared about technology and this isn't for you. Leave. If you're in YC, leave. If your objective is to raise money from egg-head Marc Andreesen, leave. If you stare at an LLM all day, leave. I will never stop flaming you retards on twitter. You don't belong here. Leave.

**Fuck the Cloud** The cloud is a highway to serfdom. Build things that run locally, that put compute in the hands of individuals, that can't be taken away or gatekept.

**Fuck Vibecoding** Building technology is a progressive learning process and way of life. Offloading cognitive function to a filipino LLM is a great way to stay stupid and build nothing useful.

**Fuck your Pedigree** No one cares about your TC, your title, or your degree. GTFO.

## Context

This follows the ideology articulated by George Hotz: that we need to drive the people who came for money and status out of technology. That we need to give it all away for free so there's no reason for them to be here. That robotics and local-first computing will restore individual sovereignty. That the goal is building one perfect box, not building a unicorn.

Mathematics and arithmetic is pure. You prove theorems for you and your boys, and no one shows up to take it away from you or corrupt it. We need to find this quality again.

 I created this because I was part of the grift. I raised money, moved to silicon valley, and worked like a slave for my investors. I am not proud of the technology I built and I want redemption. I learned to code by hacking together a runescape bot farm with OpenCV, YOLOv5, and some shitty python code. I was addicted to it for reasons I can't describe but eventually I fell to the rat race and dropped out to build a company. As soon as the technology loses priority it feels worse than being a wagie. Money wasn't enough to keep me in the factory. Right now I'm focused on returning to my roots. I'm going back to programming basics like compilers and creating technology that consumes me. I'm probably the least qualified individual to coordinate this, but take this as a committment to my rebirth.
